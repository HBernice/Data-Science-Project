# Data-Science-Project
This is a breakdown of my project from the first step of project planning to the last step of production
## Project Planning and Data Collection
I used a dataset acquired from Kaggle. My dataset is about a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification.
## Data Cleaning
This was my first step after data collection. This is where I get to manipulate the data and ensure it is ready for EDA process and the rest of the data cycle in my project.
