# Data-Science-Project
This is a breakdown of my project from the first step of project planning to the last step of model building for solving business problems defined.
## Project Planning and Data Collection
I used a dataset acquired from Kaggle. My dataset is about a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification.
## Data Cleaning
This was my first step after data collection. This is where I get to manipulate the data and ensure it is ready for EDA process and the rest of the data cycle in my project.
## EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis involves the use of visualizations to find patterns, trends and relationships between variables in the dataset. This step is valuable in the data cycle as it mainly enhances understanding of our data and a closer interaction with it.
## Model Building
This step involves understanding relationships between variables in my data and making predictions.This step is also useful in automation of decision-making and processes.
